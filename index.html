            <p class="authors-date">March 17, 2014</p>
            <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new
                son and a year&#39;s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond
                the world of known physics.</p>
                <br>
            <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
                created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential
                hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted
                a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to
                pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities.
                Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.</p>

                    <br>
                <p >On Monday, Dr. Guth&#39;s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the
                    beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.</p>

            <p class="clear">Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space
                with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent,
                architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other
                universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.</p>

                beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac&#39;s
                ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein&#39;s theory of
                general relativity, should ruffle space-time.</p>
                <br>
            <p>Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the
                team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”</p>
                <br>
            <p>He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in
                gravitational waves.”</p>
                <br>
            <p>The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that
                permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of
                the sun.</p>
                <br>
            <p>Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of
                Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics
                here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.</p>

            <p  class="spec">By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news
                spread, astrophysicists
                responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.</p>
                <br>
            <p>Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays true, it
                will go down as one of the
                greatest discoveries in the history of science.”</p>
                <br>
            <p>John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac&#39;s mentor and head of a competing
                project called the South Pole
                Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are beautiful and very convincing,” he
                said.</p>
                <br>
            <p>Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits the clash of a
                pair of universes as the
                cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model, but he expressed reservations
                about inflation.</p>
                <br>
            <p>Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation,
                noting that the new results
                exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the European Space Agency&#39;s
                Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe.</p>
                <br>
            <p>“So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own findings
                this year. At least a dozen other teams are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.

            <p>Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which
                were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel
                Prize.</p>

            <p  class="spec">Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four
                leaders of Bicep, which has
                operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates
                ideal
                observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California
                Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.</p>
                <br>
            <p>“The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac
                said. He has been there 23
                times, he said, wintering over in 1994. “I&#39;ve been hooked ever since,” he said.</p>

                <p>The Bicep2 telescope, in the foreground, was used to detect the faint spiraling gravity

            <p  class="spec font">In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was polarized,
                meaning the light waves had a
                slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.</p>
                <br>
            <p class="font">This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from inflation.
                Such waves, squeezing
                space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the direction of polarization of
                the
                microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have little arrows going in
                spirals.</p>
                <br>
            <p class="font">Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the temperature
                of the microwaves. The
                group&#39;s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.</p>
                <br>
            <p>“We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="font">The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning up time on
                a Harvard supercomputer,
                making sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might beat them to the breakthrough.</p>

            <h2 class="header2">A Special Time</h2>
            <p>The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, staying up late
                in his Palo Alto house
                35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the universe.</p>
                <br>
            <p>Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity, electromagnetism, and
                strong and weak nuclear
                forces. But they have long suspected that those are simply different manifestations of a single unified force
                that ruled
                the universe in its earliest, hottest moments.</p>
                <br>
            <p>As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, like some old
                folk mythology of gods or
                brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force after another splitting away.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>That was where Dr. Guth came in.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32
                degrees, until it is
                disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.</p>
                <br>
            <p>Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too long. In that case,
                space itself would become
                imbued with a mysterious latent energy.</p>
                <br>
            <p>Inserted into Einstein&#39;s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of antigravity,
                and the universe would blow
                itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more space was created, the harder it
                pushed apart.</p>
                <br>
            <p>What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion trillionfold —
                from a submicroscopic
                speck of primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.</p>

        <p  class="spec">Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and radiation.
            All of normal cosmic
            history was still ahead, resulting in today&#39;s observable universe, a patch of sky and stars billions of
            light-years
            across. “It&#39;s often said that there is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the
            universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”</p>
            <br>
        <p>Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth&#39;s original
            vision suggest that
            inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable homey expansion, the
            rest of
            the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept known as the multiverse.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking about going
            any deeper into the past.
        </p>
            <br>
        <p>We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because inflation
            erases everything that came
            before it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept away, forever out of our view.</p>

        <p>“If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was
            not part of the team, “you
            wind up at inflation.”</p>
